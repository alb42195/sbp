sbp - split brain prodection is a small program which should help 
to avoid split brains in a cluster.


Overview:

The program send keep alive messages via UDP and ICMP. 

UDP messages will be send direct between the configured cluster nodes.

ICMP messages will be send via node 3. To have the best verification 
node 3 should be one of the clients who are using the service of the 
cluster, or at least a entry node in to our network which the client 
flow will use. On Node 3 no software have to be installed, it just 
have to support ICMP type 0 and 8.

The main program (sbpd.py) runs as a daemon and needs a configuration 
file to be runable. The configration file (sbpd.conf) have to be locate
in one of the following locations. /etc, /usr/local/etc or in the same 
directory like sbpd.py self. 

The configuration is JSON style and there are 3
